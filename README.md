# Rubik's Cube Solver
## An intuitive Java-based application to solve any Rubik's Cube [3x3] scramble.  

I am designing a Rubik's Cube solver that will basically allow you to input a scramble of your choice and my Java-based  
desktop application will compute and display the solution to that scramble. This project can be used by anyone that does  
not know how to solve a Rubik's Cube or a learner who is trying to experiment with different algorithms.

Ever since my dad bought my first Rubik's Cube at a young age, I had been enamoured with it and had tried to  
solve it many times to no success. Then one day I decided to learn how to solve it properly and *viola!* It worked!   
Since then, I worked on getting faster. However, blind solving the famed cube still seemed wholly impossible. So,  
I took on that task as well. It was challenging to say the least but imagine my delight when I solved it! I had imagined  
it to take some next-level genius but all it took was some dedication. I imagine this project as the next level in this  
journey. I am sure that writing a program to solve the Rubik's Cube will be quite the challenge, but it will nevertheless  
be an interesting one.


A list of features the application will include:
- An intuitive graphical user interface to input your scramble. 
- A small guide to Rubik's Cube move naming conventions so that even beginners can easily follow along. 
- An easy-to-follow solution.
- Can change which face of the Cube you are facing to allow the user to work with any rotation. 
- User can save the scramble & solution at any time and reload the application with no fear of losing their scramble. 
- Can change the shades of the colours to maximize user comfort in readability.
- Can save previous scrambles along with their solutions to refer back to at any time. 

Possible Extra Features:
- An included step-by-step tutorial to teach you how to solve a [3x3] Rubik's Cube.
- Include multiple different algorithms through which the Cube can be solved. This will be useful for users trying to
  learn different ways to solve the [3x3] rubik's cube such as the blindfolded method. We can also compare the efficiency of the different algorithms.


## User Stories:

- As a user, I want to be able to add the current scramble and solution to my history of previous scrambles. 
- As a user, I want to be able to rotate the on-screen cube to show any face I want. 
- As a user, I want to be able to step through the solution and have the on-screen cube also update accordingly, so I can  
  verify if I am following the solution correctly. 
- As a user, I want to be able to save my scrambles to come back  to at anytime. 
- As a user, I want the interface to be simple, informative, and customizable to an extent.
